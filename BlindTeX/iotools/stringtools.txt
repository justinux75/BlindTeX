extractContent(completeDocument):
The method takes a string representing a LaTeX document and separates its preamble (the portion before "\begin{document}"), its content and its epilogue (after \end{document}) and returns them in a list.

                Returns:
                        (list(str)): A list with all the labels found.

insertConveertedFormulas(stringDocument, inlineList, displayList, format):
Insert all the LaTeX formulas in the lists, already converted, the replacement is done in order of appearance with the marker put before.
		Args:
			stringDocument(str): the html/LaTeX document, product of the conversion from LaTeX to html/.
			inlineList(str): the list with all the inline formulas written in LaTeX.
			displayList(str): the list with all the  display formulas written in LaTeX.
			format(int): indicates the begining and the ending of the formula to be inserted for the format of the final file. 0 and 2 for html, 1 for txt and 3 for tex.
		Returns:
			str: the html document but with all the formulas inserted. 

insertReferences(stringDocument, listLabels):
Inserts the references changed in the  document.
                Args:
                        stringDocument(str):The document where the replacement will be done.
                        listLabels(list(str)): The labels in the formulas.
                Returns
                        (str): The document with all the references inserted.

replaceRefs(stringDocument, listLabels):
Replaces the references in the document for easy to find flags.
                Args:
                        stringDocument(str): The document to look for.
                        listLabels(list(str)): The list with all the labels found.
                Returns:
                        (str):The document with all the references replaced.

reportProblem(strBadFormulas):
This function gathers all the formulas the lexer or parser had problems with and then send it to being writed in a file.
                Args:
                        strBadFormula(str): The guilty string. Sended by Parser.

seekAndReplaceFormulas(document):
Search for all the math formulas in the document, when one is found first, the function copies the formula in a list; then the function replace the formula for a marker to future uses.
		Args:
			document(str): the LaTeX content.
		Returns:
			namedTuple:A named Tuple called documentAndLists where:
						replacedDocument is the string with all the formulas replaced by markers.
						inline/displayList  is the list with all the inline/display formulas found.

DATA:
delimiters: a list of all delimiters for math in a LaTeX document.
